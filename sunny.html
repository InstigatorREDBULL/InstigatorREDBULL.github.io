        <h5>Story</h5>
        <br>
        <p>This commission is a remake, <strong>with edits to add more detail</strong> of the <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/paisley2themax/art/Commission-Maid-Vore-and-Fart-829669965">2D comic by paisley2themax</a> which I commissioned back in 2018.</p>

        <p>Whereas the <i>original was just 8 tiny panels crammed on to a sheet of paper</i>, this will tentaively be 14 panels.</p>

        <br />
        <p><strong>As a high-level overview:</strong></p>
        <p>Makana picks the first room to clean and discovers it has accumulated garbage which would take too much time to clean by hand. So she decides to use her vacuum-disposal mechanism to get the job done in no time flat. The process sucks up all non-anchored objects including 2 average-size women out cold within the garbage. Everything is sent to her belly. Once all collected, Makana pulls on her belly ring, activating her compression cycle and the contents are compressed into gas to be expelled once complete to replace the air of the room. To her surprise, the compression grants her curvier assets, and a little height.</p>

                <li><i>I'd like to add some sort of object so that we can compare Makana's original height with her new height later on: maybe a painting or a switch on the wall to the left? This object will show up in the last panel where Makana admires her curves from the front so that we can see how much taller she has grown as the object won't move.</i></li>

                <p><strong>I'm emphasizing the below because I find it important yet hard to explain.</strong></p>

                <br />
                <p><strong>The difference from the clip above</strong> is that I'd prefer if Makana's lips still looked sexy & puffy around the edges like in the comic i first showed you. here's a reference, along with a similar character's ability to vacuum things in case you'd like a little more inspiration:</p>

                <p>The white text in the image source below is what I had sent over to the 2D artist for later comics as a more detailed reference.</p>
