        <h5>Description</h5>
        <br>
        <details>
            <summary>Summary of Makana as observed <strong>(click to open)</strong> </summary>
            <br/>
            <p>Makana is an unfinished cyborg dressed in a suggestive French maid's outfit.</p>
                
            <p>Makana was created initially for clearing out trash and leaving no traces behind.</p>
                
            <p>Her creator's whereabouts remain unknown and is implied to have suffered the same fate as all who were unfortunate enough to cross her path.</p>

            <p>Makana uses her mouth like a vacuum to suck things down into her belly. More often than not, this happens against her will or without knowing this will result in accidental consumption of people.</p>
                
            <p>After a very short time, whatever is in her belly gets compressed down.</p>

            <p>Things can only enter her system through her mouth, and exit out through her derriere. This always results in forceful farts, reeking of whatever she just compressed.</p>
                
            <p>Compressing down contents seems to add mass on to her (at first) petite frame, making her abilities more potent.</p>

            <p>Despite having an unsatiable hunger, Makana controls herself to only vacuum and swallow things which she believes she can clean.</p>
                
            <p>One can make the argument she does things to help man-kind, but something always seems to go wrong, ending in the unfortunate disappearence of anything in front of her.</p>

            <p>Makana's first instinct is to keep a sense of normality by being positive and adopting an assertive attitude to her 'job'.</p>

            <p>Makana has a fixed amount of energy she can dedicate to her functions at any given time. Makana cannot use her vacuum while keeping her vision up.</p>
        </details>

        <p>Upon further investigation, it has been found that Makana has the following missing components;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A tongue & teeth</strong>: Makana has no tongue and no teeth, so she cannot chew or taste like ordinary people. Inside her mouth is pitch black. Her speech has a faint, synthesized effect to it.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart gadget management</strong>: the ability to know when a module has been altered, such as knowing that she has been tampered while being distracted</li>
            <li><strong>Frame miniaturisation</strong>: the ability to rescale herself without losing any of her mass.</li>
            <li><strong>Selective inventory reproduction</strong>: the ability to selectively reproduce anything she has compressed down at will, such as a VIP</li>
            <li><strong>Strength accumulation</strong>: the ability to accumulate strength to support herself better. By default she feels like a lanky 5'6" woman</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Expulsion control</strong>: the ability to temper the potency / decide whatever comes out the back, if at all</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Chamber control</strong>: the ability to know if any jams / blockages occur during compression, resulting in inconsistant efficiency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Abilities</h5>
        <br>

                            <br/>
                            <p>Her mouth stretches bigger to initiate her vacuum procedure, sucking in stuff in front of her. This can be done at her own volition, or with very little movement of her mouth by an external party without her knowing. </p>
                            <p>Adding on, if Makana were to <i>burp</i>, or <i>hiccup</i>, or <i>pout</i> her lips, or <i>exhale</i> deeply, it would also activate her vacuum mouth.</p>
                            <p><i>Rubbing Makana's belly while she is filled up seems to also trigger her vacuum mouth: most likely due to causing a feeling similar to 'indigestion' in ordinary people.</i> </p>
                            <p>Vacuumed objects will be compacted into her <strong>belly</strong> giving her a <strong>muffin-top</strong>.</p>
                            <p>The bigger Makana is from her normal height, the more effective and larger in scale her vacuum's suction strength is. </p>
                            <p>She has <strong><u>2 suction strength options</u></strong>, which can be toggled by rotating the ring on her choker (like a dial) to the left. This will cycle the Suction strength mode.</p>

                            <p><strong>Normal:</strong></p>

                                <li>Able to suck up objects as heavy as average-sized humans.</li>
                                <li><span style="color: red;">This function requires Makana to shut down at least one of her other augments to work. Her <u>Vision</u> is the simplest, so her eyes close.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>MAXIMUM:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Makana's mouth fully opens up (larger than Normal), in case of emergency or to speed up the job.</li>
                                <li>This mode will suck up almost everything in a 170 degree angle in front of her. </li>
                                <li><span style="color: red;">This mode requires more energy than Normal to activate and will shut down all other augments. This includes: <u>Vision</u>, <u>Processing</u>, <u>Pressure Release</u>, Movement and Audio.</span></li>

                            <p>Upon vacuuming stuff into her belly, Makana can process the contents inside. <del>By default, this option is set to <strong>Compression</strong>.</del></p>

                            <p>Contents in her belly can either be compressed or ejected (explained in <strong>Expulsion</strong>).</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Compression:</strong> everything gets <u>miniaturised</u> into a cryogenic state, with all the mass being put to better use on her frame.</li>
                                <li><del><strong>Package:</strong> the ability to package contents inside her belly with industry-grade plastic for no leaks.</del></li>
                                <li><del><strong>Rinse:</strong> the ability to wash the contents inside like a washing machine.</del></li>
                                <li><del><strong>Freeze:</strong> the ability to cool the contents until they are frozen.</del></li>
                                <li><del><strong>Heat:</strong> the ability to heat the contents inside, including cooking, boiling, steam, frying and burning.</del></li>
                                <li><del><strong>Iron:</strong> the ability to iron objects, usually clothes, so that they are smooth and without wrinkles.</del></li>
                                <li><del><strong>Sedate:</strong> the ability to put the contents inside into a 'sleepy' state for a while.</del></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Alternatively, no action can be taken and the contents will remain safe and unaffected inside Makana's belly, acting as a sort of physical storage until <del>a function</del> is activated.</p>

                            <br/>
                            <p>This is the delay with which to process contents inside.</p>
                            <p>Makana has <strong><u>3 speed modes</u></strong>, which can be toggled by rotating the <del>ring</del> dial on her choker (like a dial) to the right. This will cycle the Processing Speed mode.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Manual mode:</strong> 
                                <br/>
                                In this mode, Makana's belly waits for her to physically activate Compression by pulling on her belly-ring (explained later in <strong>Forced Processing</strong>). 
                                <br/>
                                Visually, everything is forcefully <u>flushed</u> (audibly) down through a narrow entrance, displaying a large <strong>muffin-top</strong> as it all forces its way over her hips as it enters the lower half of her body. This is often times misjudged for 'digesting' her food. 
                                <br/>
                                <strong><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/cratedcheese" target="_blank">CratedCheese</a> has illustrated the process twice, first <a href="images/CratedCheese-454139-experiment 1.gif" target="_blank">here</a> and then <a href="images/dapqnyr-fa0cabc1-3ea8-4b3e-934e-94dedabec624.gif" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></li>

                                <li><strong>Automatic mode:</strong>
                                <br/>
                                In this mode, contents are processed automatically in a queue (instant compression) as they enter her belly. This requires more energy to work and results in only 60% of the processed contents added to her frame.</li>
                                <i>Automatic mode is the quickest, noisiest and most energy-intensive mode.</i>
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                <li><strong>Background mode:</strong> 
                                <br/>    
                                This is the slowest mode for processing, where contents are processed as slowly, quietly and efficiently as possible. Expulsion (farts) is still present, and is heard like a balloon is deflating from her rear.</li>

                            <br/>
                            <p>This is used in conjunction with Manual compression mode.</p>
                            <p>Pulling on Makana's belly-ring will reveal it stretches like a pull cord (Woody from Toy Story has one) or an old-school pull chain system on a toilet.</p>
                            <p>This means that Makana (or anyone who knows) can forcefully start processing the contents inside her belly by pulling on her belly-ring.</p>
                            <p>Another use-case is to clear any jams/blockages inside her system, causing a hard-reset of her compression cycle.</p>
                            <p style="color: red;">If her belly is too big, meaning Makana cannot reach her belly-ring, Makana must resort to switching <strong>Processing</strong> mode to <i>Automatic</i> or <i>Background</i> to start Compression.</p>

                            <br/>
                            <p>Any excess materials once compressed are expelled (<strong>farted</strong>) through Makana's rear back into the world. Pressure builds up <i>exponentially</i> (not 1:1 mass:gas!) in her booty. </p>
                            
                            <p>Any <strong>flesh</strong> compressed releases a barrage of multiple, forceful farts. <strong>Other materials</strong> simply release one long constant fart, sort of like a huge exhaust. </p>

                            <p>If Makana has mass to spare (on her <strong>curves / assets</strong>), she may fart on-command using the excess mass as ammo, by pulling on her belly-ring to trigger the conversion. </p>
                                
                            <p>The distribution pressure can be adjusted by <strong>spreading</strong> her ass cheeks to distribute more at a time, or less by <strong>clenching</strong> them.</p>

                            <p>Curiously, another way to <strong>force out contents</strong> from her belly before compression starts is by applying a <i>plunger</i> to her butt. This seems to pump the contents from her belly into her butt where they can be <i>ejected</i> out safely, <i>or act as an alternative to clearing jams / blockages.</i></p>

        <p>Retrospective: This was her first appearance ever, and, I decided it's better to keep her look for consistency, instead of changing her look to v2.0. The tricky bit is thinking up something as simple for a part 2.</p>

        <br />
        <p><strong>Story Sent</strong></p>
        <p>A maid is doing her rounds and discovers the next room has accumulated garbage which would take too much time to clean. So she decides to make use of her vacuum-disposal mechanism to get the job done in no time flat. The process sucks up all non-furniture objects including a heavy-sleeping average-size woman. All the garbage is sent to her belly. Once all collected, she pulls on her belly ring and the contents are compressed into gas to be expelled once complete, and replace the air of the room. To her surprise, the compression grants her curvier assets in all the right places.</p>

        <p><strong>Story Sent</strong></p>
        <p>The maid has cleared the current floor and sees an elevator with garbage in it - she couldn't pass this up, where it's going there's probably more. Once inside the elevator with 2 service workers, the destination floor is input, yet the elevator reports the maximum weight has been reached and it cannot move. So the maid has an idea and gestures as such. The 2 service workers see the maid's mouth suddenly deform and contort, vacuuming up all the garbage they collected around them. To their horror, it's powerful to suck them off their feet and before they know it everything goes black. The elevator now reports a manageable weight, so the maid stops her vacuum. Looking around, she is disappointed to have turned another 2 people into farts. And not a moment too soon as the maid is almost too big to fit in the elevator. The destination floor? An incinerator room, chock full of garbage ready for digestion!</p>

        <p>Retrospective: Should have done a shorter story or had more panels and definitely some form of dialogue.</p>

        <strong>Story Sent</strong>
        <p>Her next job has her enter into a dim-lit room. It's larger than the first, which means she needs to spread her air-freshener (farts) equally. For this, she sets her compression to Automatic (not manual) so that she can  vacuum and compress objects on the go. While doing this, she releases bursts of fresh air from her rear. Due to only needing to keep her head up, she doesn't notice a sticky surface on the ground, causing her to trip and fall forward on to her belly. This causes her suction-strength to shift to Maximum (from High). This makes her vacuum whole furniture & things anchored down including the chandelier. By the time she notices this and has turned her vacuum off, she has vacuumed up everything in the room, and a sound begins growing in her belly. This much mass causes her belly to rumble, and takes a few seconds to process & compress. And so, she closes her eyes, bites her lip seductively, and bombs the room with air-freshener while laying on her belly. She emerges from the fumes/thick cloud, out of the room still farting, yet proud.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Moving on to the next room, Makana looms over the person inside who is packing up gadgets/small appliances into garbage bags and still has a ways to go. The person is delighted she has help, to which Makana gestures 'i've got this'. Makana closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, activating her vacuum, and sucking in everything in theroom, including the person. On noticing she's not sucking in anymore stuff, Makana looks around for the person as she automatically compresses, farts proudly and grows bigger, much to her realisation of voring someone. She hears a phone ring inside a closet in the same room. Going inside, she sees more garbage and hears someone call the name of the person she vored. Thinking quickly, Makana changes Processing speed to Manual, vacuums up all the garbage in the big closet, and hides behind the door. The people follow the sound of the phone ringing to the closet, they go inside and hear it inside something soft, they grope it until suddenly looking up to Makana's mouth deforming into her vacuum mouth. Makana vacuums them up, with one of them grabbing on to her belly ring, stretching it out and stopping them from entering. Makana tilts her head up and the 2 people sink down her mouth (letting go of the belly ring) with Makana's mouth reforming back to normal, ending with the burp she was supposed to let out. Needless to say, Makana has another compression & growth sequence, now almost wider than the door and almost as tall asthe ceiling.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>A couple (or 2 girls) approach Makana asking where their room is. Both girls seem to be tipsy and carrying beer on them, so they need help. Makana gestures to mean they're on the wrong floor. One of them decides to visit the bathroom, while the other waits outside, and observes Makana. Makana stuffs a garbage bin into her mouth, as the girl observing Makana is visually disturbed by the sight/thought of eating garbage. Makana automatically releases a fart, which pushes the observing girl down into a garbage chute she was standing behind. Makana hears this and attempts to remedy the situation by going MAXIMUM and Manual, applying her vacuum mouth to the garbage chute door, sucking up her and garbage back up to through the door and into her belly. Makana is visually confused and begins getting tipsy. The other girl comes out of the bathroom and at her eye-level can only see Makana's legs (socks), before Makana starts losing her balance and falls on back on to her butt against a wall. The girl from the bathroom approaches her to get a better look before Makana hiccups, and the girl gets to see first hand what gazing into the abyss looks like, along with coke and mentos from a nearby vending machine. This concoction in her belly is causing the largest tummy ache she has ever had, so Makana gets up, hiccups and vacuums other stuff briefly in the hallway. She finds and opens the door to a room to just stick her butt in and pull on her belly ring to release everything, hoping it fixes whatever is wrong wih her. The room is totalled. Makana now might as well walk on all 4's to get around, as she would need to bend over to walk normally. </p>

            <p>A person is taking out garbage bags next to a bigger garbage bin, Makana notices and wishes to help by staying hidden (behind a fence? behind a tree? in a bush? behind a corner?) and making the bags dissappear for them. </p>
            <p>Little does Makana know that people are naturally curious, so after the last bag the person steps where they put the garbage bags and gets accidentally vacuumed up, as Makana thinks it's another garbage bag. </p>
            <p>Supposed to be a 'feed me' skit, where we see her grow bigger after each vacuum like she's being force-fed (and loving it).</p>

            <p>Makana vacuums something and forgets she's on automatic, so she farts as usual. She either farts in the direction of the thing, or quick-thinking, she decides to sit her butt down to protect anything from her farts, but it backfires anyway when the rumble causes things to fall off their place. </p>
            <p>She ends up needing to vacuum hide her mess, but may need to switch Processing speed to Manual first in case she gets any <i>undeserved</i> attention.</p>

            <summary>Conjecture</summary>
            </br>
            <p>Long ago, a perverted scientist wanted to make the perfect servant, away from prying eyes. And he managed, he made a multi-purpose maid which could take care of him and his house, but had no conscience.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the Russians kept experimenting with nuclear power. One day though the next step in russian warfare to overthrow the american flag was to combine their (insatiable) women with their technology. To prototype, the Russians decided it would be best to first clean up their nuclear fallout at home. And so they did, they crafted what they called a 'Radiation Collection Unit', which could suck up any and all radiation she could detect, while remaining sexy. As a side-effect by the scientist, the Radiation Collector seemed to grow bigger with all the compressed radiation as mass. The tunguska event is said to have been the fancy work of the Radiation Collector, leaving no trace of radiation behind. Needless to say, something went wrong during testing as radio communication to the Radiaiton Collector sent improper signals, causing the Radiation Collector to go wild and get rid of a huge chunk of the russian nuclear arsenal. The experiment was deemed a failure, and abandoned, but only after the experiment having cost the government every ruble to cover up the accident.</p>

            <p>The perverted scientist was getting closer to a breakthrough AI so smart it could pass the turing test with flying colors. One day a mysterious gift was left at his door, labelled "declassified". It had been the Radiation Collector, well what was left of it. The scientist's research had paid off as the government wanted to see what this old man could do now if he applied his smart AI to the recovered Radiation Collector. And so the scientist got to work merging his invention with the recovered Radiation Collector, creating an even more lewd machination.</p>

            <p>On the day he wanted to showcase his handy-work to the world, to a hotel not far from his laboratory, something went wrong for the scientist. It is believed, he is the first victim of the monster he created. But not before letting her know her purpose...</p>

            <summary>Discussion</summary>
            <br/>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> Makana is at most an A-Tier predator in my fetish emporium. There are plenty of other predators more effective at her trade, but she could definitely make swiss cheese of anyone below her tier.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not nigh-invulnerable to brute force like all the S-Tiers, susceptible to acid, has no regeneration capability, noisey shoes & gadgets, and her strongest move (MAXIMUM), takes a while to start up and locks her in place.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> What she does have going for her however is her immunity to smell, great crowd control (#1 in vacuuming), probably the windiest farts, and hiding stuff away thanks to miniaturisation. One could even say her night vision up to a certain extent, but she's not the only one with it.</li>
