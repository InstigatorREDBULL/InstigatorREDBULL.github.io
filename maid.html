        <h5>Description</h5>
        <br>
        <details>
            <summary>Summary of the Maid as observed <strong>(click to open)</strong> </summary>
            <br/>
            <p>The maid is a petite unfinished cyborg, created initially for clearing out trash and leaving no traces behind. The creator's whereabouts remain unknown and is implied to have suffered the same fate as all who where unfortunate enough to cross her path.</p>

            <p>The maid uses her mouth like a vacuum to suck things into her belly, more often than not, against her will or without prior knowledge of her actions resulting in seemingly accidental scenarios. After a very short time, the contents compress down. Things can only enter her system through her mouth, and exit out through her derriere. Speaking of which, this seems to always result in forceful farts. </p>
                
            <p>Compressing down contents seems to convert mass on to her frame, making the problem worse as the larger she becomes, the more potent her abilities.</p>

            <p>Despite her nightmare-fuel implications, her first instinct is to keep a sense of normality by being positive and adopting an assertive attitude. Despite an unsatiable hunger, she does not resort to fill her belly whenever she has the chance. One can make the argument she does things to help man-kind, but something always seems to go wrong, ending in the unfortunate disappearence of anything in front of her.</p>

            <p>Curious to note, aside from her primary function of disposal, the maid was slated to be mass produced and earn the creator heaps of money, by creating copies of itself - after each successful job. Each new copy better than the last as they add new modules/components missing from its predecessor.</p>
        </details>

        <p>Upon investigation of the creator's abode, it has been found that the original copy has the following missing components;</p>
        <ul>
            <del><li><strong>Speech</strong>: the ability to speak like a human</li></del>
            <li><strong>Smart gadget management</strong>: the ability to know when a module has been altered, such as knowing that she has been tampered while being distracted</li>
            <li><strong>Frame miniaturisation</strong>: the ability to rescale herself without losing any of the gains</li>
            <li><strong>Selective inventory reproduction</strong>: the ability to selectively reproduce anything she has compressed down at will, such as a VIP</li>
            <li><strong>Strength accumulation</strong>: the ability to accumulate added strength to support herself better, by default she feels like a lanky 5'6" woman</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Expulsion control</strong>: the ability to temper the potency / decide whatever comes out the back, if at all</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Chamber control</strong>: the ability to know if any jams / blockages occur during compression, resulting in less efficiency</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Abilities</h5>
        <br>
        <p>The maid has had numerous augments to her body to grant her the abilities she has.</p>

        <p>An example of some of these functions in action has been illustrated by paisley2themax <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/paisley2themax/art/Commission-Maid-Vore-and-Fart-829669965">here.</a></p>

                            <br/>
                            <p>Her mouth stretches bigger to initiate her vacuum procedure, sucking in stuff in front of her. This can be done at her own volition, with ease. </p>
                            <p>Vacuumed objects will be compacted into her <strong>belly</strong> giving her a <strong>muffin-top</strong>. If she were to either <i>burp</i>, <i>hiccup</i>, <i>pout</i> her lips or <i>exhale</i> deeply, it would also activate her vacuum mouth. <i>Rubbing her belly while full has also seemed to result in the vacuum being triggered.</i> </p>
                            <p>The bigger she is from normal height, the more effective and larger in scale her mouth deforms. She has <strong><u>2 suction strength options</u></strong>, which can be toggled by rotating the ring on her choker (like a dial) to the left. This will cycle the Suction strength mode.</p>

                            <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Originally the size of a vacuum hose-top. Able to suck up objects as heavy as humans.</p>

                            <p><strong>MAXIMUM:</strong> Even larger than Normal, supposed to be used in emergencies or to speed up clean-up. Can and will suck up almost anything in a 170 degree angle. 
                            <span style="color: red;">Requires more power to operate and will shut down other augments to work properly, such as <u>Vision</u> (eyes close), or <u>Processing Speed</u> (conflicts with Automatic as it requires extra power too).</span></p>

                            <br/>
                            <p>Upon vacuuming stuff into her belly, the maid can process the contents inside. <del>By default, this option is set to <strong>Compression</strong>, unaware of other modes. Other unused modes include Rinse, Disinfect, Freeze, Heat and <strong>Package</strong>.</del>
                            <p><strong>Compression:</strong> The contents inside her belly get <u>miniaturised</u> into a cryogenic state, with all the mass being put to better use on her frame. The content is <u>flushed</u> (audible) down and can be seen forcing it's way over her hips giving her a <strong>large muffin-top</strong> as it enters the lower half of her body. This is by far the most advanced augment in her, and often times misjudged for 'digesting' her food. <strong>For reference <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/cratedcheese" target="_blank">CratedCheese</a> has illustrated the <a href="images/CratedCheese-454139-experiment 1.gif" target="_blank">process</a>, <a href="images/dapqnyr-fa0cabc1-3ea8-4b3e-934e-94dedabec624.gif" target="_blank">twice</a>.</strong></p>
                            <del><p><strong>Package:</strong> May be seen one day. The maid is able to package contents inside her belly with industry-grade plastic for no leaks, and output them through the rear.</p></del>

                            <p>This is the delay with which to process contents inside. She has <strong><u>3 speed  options</u></strong>, which can be toggled by rotating the <del>ring</del> on her choker (like a dial) to the right. This will cycle the Processing Speed mode.</p>
                            <p><strong>Manual:</strong> Waits for the maid to trigger processing by pulling on her belly ring (like an old-school chain-pull system on a toilet) - the mass is forcefully flushed downward through another narrow entrance, displaying a large muffin-top as the maid pushes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Automatic:</strong> This processes objects automatically in a queue as they enter her belly. This requires more power/energy to work and results in only 60% of the processed contents added to her frame. <span style="color: red;">Cannot operate at the same time as <u>MAXIMUM</u> suction strength.</span></p>
                            <p><strong>Background:</strong> The slowest type of processing, where contents are processed as slowly, quietly and efficiently as possible. Pressure Release is still present, and can be heard as a balloon deflating.</p>

                            <p>If at any time the maid wishes to force processing of contents inside, she need only pull her belly-ring.</p>
                            <p>Primarily, this is used if a jam is suspected, to hard-reset the compression cycle and force-clean out contents, often times putting strain on the system and drawing more power than normal.</p>
                            <p style="color: red;">If her belly is too big and stretched out, meaning she cannot reach the belly-ring, she must resort to switching <strong>Processing</strong> mode to <i>Automatc</i> or <i>Background</i>.</p>

                            <br/>
                            <p>Any excess materials are compressed and <strong>farted</strong> through the rear back into the world. The more content processed, the more pressure builds up <i>exponentially</i>. </p>
                            
                            <p>Any <strong>flesh</strong> compressed releases a barrage of multiple, forceful farts. <strong>Other materials</strong> simply release one long constant fart, sort of like a huge exhaust. </p>

                            <p>If the maid has larger <strong>curves / assets</strong> than normal, she may use this excess mass voluntarily (as a form of fart-on-command) when her belly has no mass, by pulling on her belly-ring. </p>
                                
                            <p>The distribution pressure can be adjusted by <strong>spreading</strong> her ass cheeks to distribute more at a time, or less by <strong>clenching</strong> them.</p>

                            <p>Another curiosity seems to be the ability of <strong>forcing out the contents</strong> in her belly before compression by applying a <i>plunger</i> to her butt. This seems to shift the contents to into the <strong>gas chamber</strong> where they can be <i>ejected</i> out as though nothing happened, <i>or act as an alternative to clearing jams / blockages.</i></p>

                            <p>The purpose of this growth is supposed to be the creator's way of storing ammunition (gas) for voluntary use when there is no mass in her belly to compress.</p>
                            
                            <p>Any form of meat or flesh <strong>adds to her curves</strong>, primarily her butt, then her hips & thighs & feet, and lastly her breasts. Any non-meat, will be <strong>added to her height.</strong></p>

                            <p>If we are to get technical, it is assumed flesh is divided <strong>40%</strong> to her <i>butt</i>, <strong>30%</strong> to her <i>hips</i> & <i>thighs</i> & <i>feet</i>, and <strong>20%</strong> to her <i>breasts</i>, with the last <strong>10%</strong> to her <i>height</i> (negligible).</p>

        <h5>Personality</h5>

        <p>Despite what her functions entail, <strong>the maid would rather use her functions to help</strong> where she thinks she can. This what gets her into all the <strong>accidental vore</strong> scenarios.</p>

        <p>She is <strong>gentle</strong>, and would rather not vacuum anything she knows is alive, unless there is good reason. She is in fact <strong>literate, and understands English.</strong></p>

        <p>The maid exhibits an <strong>alluring</strong> demeanour (almost aphrodisiac) with her <strong>half-open eye</strong> look.</p>

        <p><strong>Story Sent</strong></p>
        <p>A maid is doing her rounds and discovers the next room has accumulated garbage which would take too much time to clean. So she decides to make use of her vacuum-disposal mechanism to get the job done in no time flat. The process sucks up all non-furniture objects including a heavy-sleeping average-size woman. All the garbage is sent to her belly. Once all collected, she pulls on her belly ring and the contents are compressed into gas to be expelled once complete, and replace the air of the room. To her surprise, the compression grants her curvier assets in all the right places.</p>

        <strong>Story Sent</strong>
        <p>Her next job has her enter into a dim-lit room. It's larger than the first, which means she needs to spread her air-freshener (farts) equally. For this, she sets her compression to Automatic (not manual) so that she can  vacuum and compress objects on the go. While doing this, she releases bursts of fresh air from her rear. Due to only needing to keep her head up, she doesn't notice a sticky surface on the ground, causing her to trip and fall forward on to her belly. This causes her suction-strength to shift to Maximum (from High). This makes her vacuum whole furniture & things anchored down including the chandelier. By the time she notices this and has turned her vacuum off, she has vacuumed up everything in the room, and a sound begins growing in her belly. This much mass causes her belly to rumble, and takes a few seconds to process & compress. And so, she closes her eyes, bites her lip seductively, and bombs the room with air-freshener while laying on her belly. She emerges from the fumes/thick cloud, out of the room still farting, yet proud.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Moving on to the next room, the maid looms over the person inside who is packing up gadgets/small appliances into garbage bags and still has a ways to go. The person is delighted she has help, to which the maid gestures 'i've got this'. The maid closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, activating her vacuum, and sucking in everything in theroom, including the person. On noticing she's not sucking in anymore stuff, the maid looks around for the person as she automatically compresses, farts proudly and grows bigger, much to her realisation of voring someone. She hears a phone ring inside a closet in the same room. Going inside, she sees more garbage and hears someone call the name of the person she vored. Thinking quickly, the maid changes Processing speed to Manual, vacuums up all the garbage in the big closet, and hides behind the door. The people follow the sound of the phone ringing to the closet, they go inside and hear it inside something soft, they grope it until suddenly looking up to the maid's mouth deforming into her vacuum mouth. The maid vacuums them up, with one of them grabbing on to her belly ring, stretching it out and stopping them from entering. The maid tilts her head up and the 2 people sink down her mouth (letting go of the belly ring) with the maid's mouth reforming back to normal, ending with the burp she was supposed to let out. Needless to say, the maid has another compression & growth sequence, now almost wider than the door and almost as tall asthe ceiling.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>A couple (or 2 girls) approach the maid asking where their room is. Both girls seem to be tipsy and carrying beer on them, so they need help. The maid gestures to mean they're on the wrong floor. One of them decides to visit the bathroom, while the other waits outside, and observes the maid. The maid stuffs a garbage bin into her mouth, as the girl observing the maid is visually disturbed by the sight/thought of eating garbage. The maid automatically releases a fart, which pushes the observing girl down into a garbage chute she was standing behind. The maid hears this and attempts to remedy the situation by going MAXIMUM and Manual, applying her vacuum mouth to the garbage chute door, sucking up her and garbage back up to through the door and into her belly. The maid is visually confused and begins getting tipsy. The other girl comes out of the bathroom and at her eye-level can only see the maid's legs (socks), before the maid starts losing her balance and falls on back on to her butt against a wall. The girl from the bathroom approaches her to get a better look before the maid hiccups, and the girl gets to see first hand what gazing into the abyss looks like, along with coke and mentos from a nearby vending machine. This concoction in her belly is causing the largest tummy ache she has ever had, so the maid gets up, hiccups and vacuums other stuff briefly in the hallway. She finds and opens the door to a room to just stick her butt in and pull on her belly ring to release everything, hoping it fixes whatever is wrong wih her. The room is totalled. The maid now might as well walk on all 4's to get around, as she would need to bend over to walk normally. </p>

            <p>A person is taking out garbage bags next to a bigger garbage bin, the maid notices and wishes to help by staying hidden (behind a fence? behind a tree? in a bush? behind a corner?) and making the bags dissappear for them. </p>
            <p>Little does the maid know that people are naturally curious, so after the last bag the person steps where they put the garbage bags and gets accidentally vacuumed up, as the maid thinks it's another garbage bag. </p>

            <p>The maid seems to have cleared out the floor she is on, and decides to use the elevator to check the next floor. On her way there she vacuums a few bins and switches Processing speed to background so that she doesn't need to stop and get maximum benefit. There are 2 people inside, a manager and a guest. Upon entering and selecting floor, the elevator reports that there's too much weight. So the manager has a bit of a fit, flailing their arms around. The manager accidentally pulls on the maid's belly ring, forcing the maid to start her compression. This causes her to release a fart potent enough to knock them out. not taking any chances and hoping the hotel would be in a better palce without the tragedy being seen, the maid leaves no traces behind. The elevator no lnoger reports too much weight and proceeds to move up. Upon opening up again, the maid had to sit down to be comfy inside. She walks out towering over everyone. </p>

            <summary>Conjecture</summary>
            </br>
            <p>Long ago, a perverted scientist wanted to make the perfect servant, away from prying eyes. And he managed, he made a multi-purpose maid which could take care of him and his house, but had no conscience.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the Russians kept experimenting with nuclear power. One day though the next step in russian warfare to overthrow the american flag was to combine their (insatiable) women with their technology. To prototype, the Russians decided it would be best to first clean up their nuclear fallout at home. And so they did, they crafted what they called a 'Radiation Collection Unit', which could suck up any and all radiation she could detect, while remaining sexy. As a side-effect by the scientist, the Radiation Collector seemed to grow bigger with all the compressed radiation as mass. The tunguska event is said to have been the fancy work of the Radiation Collector, leaving no trace of radiation behind. Needless to say, something went wrong during testing as radio communication to the Radiaiton Collector sent improper signals, causing the Radiation Collector to go wild and get rid of a huge chunk of the russian nuclear arsenal. The experiment was deemed a failure, and abandoned, but only after the experiment having cost the government every ruble to cover up the accident.</p>

            <p>The perverted scientist was getting closer to a breakthrough AI so smart it could pass the turing test with flying colors. One day a mysterious gift was left at his door, labelled "declassified". It had been the Radiation Collector, well what was left of it. The scientist's research had paid off as the government wanted to see what this old man could do now if he applied his smart AI to the recovered Radiation Collector. And so the scientist got to work merging his invention with the recovered Radiation Collector, creating an even more lewd machination.</p>

            <p>On the day he wanted to showcase his handy-work to the world, to a hotel not far from his laboratory, something went wrong for the scientist. It is believed, he is the first victim of the monster he created. But not before letting her know her purpose...</p>

            <summary>Discussion</summary>
            <br/>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> The maid is at most an A-Tier predator in my fetish emporium. There are plenty of other predators more effective at her trade, but she could definitely make swiss cheese of anyone below her tier.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not nigh-invulnerable to brute force like all the S-Tiers, susceptible to acid, has no regeneration capability, noisey shoes & gadgets, and her strongest move (MAXIMUM), takes a while to start up and locks her in place.</li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> What she does have going for her however is her immunity to smell, great crowd control (#1 in vacuuming), probably the windiest farts, and hiding stuff away thanks to miniaturisation. One could even say her night vision up to a certain extent, but she's not the only one with it.</li>
