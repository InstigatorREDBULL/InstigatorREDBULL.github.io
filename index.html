        <summary>Summary of the Maid as observed <strong>(click to open)</strong> </summary>
        <br/>
        <p>The maid is a petite unfinished cyborg, created initially for clearing out trash and leaving no traces behind. The creator's whereabouts remain unknown and is implied to have suffered the same fate as all who where unfortunate enough to cross her path.</p>

        <p>The maid uses her mouth like a vacuum to suck things into her belly, more often than not, against her will or without prior knowledge of her actions resulting in seemingly accidental scenarios. Things can only enter her system through her mouth, and exit out through her derriere. Speaking of which, this seems to  always result in forceful farts, albeit not as uncommon as once tought given all the other women who have shown to have similar vorish appetites sharing the same ability in this world. Compressing down contents seems to convert mass on to her frame, in some instances making the problem worse, as the larger she becomes, the less control  people have around her.</p>

        <p>Despite her nightmare-fuel implications, it has been observed that she has a gentle demeanour, not resorting to fill her belly whenever she has the chance. One can make the argument she does things to help man-kind, but something always seems to go wrong, ending in the unfortunate disappearence of anything in front of her.</p>

        <p>Curious to note, aside from its primary function of disposal, the maid was slated to be mass produced and earn the creator heaps of money, by creating copies of itself - each new copy better than the last with the added bonus of completing some of the modules/components missing from its predecessor.</p>
    </details>

    <p>Upon investigation of the creator's abode, it has been foundthat the original copy has the following missing components;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Speech</strong>: the ability to speak like a human</li>
        <li><strong>Smart gadget management</strong>: the ability for the maid to instinctively know when a module has had changes done to it</li>
        <li><strong>Frame miniaturisation</strong>: the ability to rescale herself without losing any of the gains</li>
        <li><strong>Selective inventory reproduction</strong>: the ability to selectively reproduce anything she has compressed down at will</li>
        <li><strong>Strength accumulation</strong>: the ability to transform or accumulate added strength to support herself better</li>
        <li><strong>Expulsion control</strong>: the ability to temper the potency of whatever comes out the back</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>
    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">Functions</h5>

    <p>The maid has had numerous augments to her body to grant her the abilities she has.</p>

    <p>An example of some of these functions in action has been illustrated by paisley2themax <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/paisley2themax/art/Commission-Maid-Vore-and-Fart-829669965">here.</a></p>

                        <summary>Suction (Normal | MAX)</summary>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Her mouth stretches bigger to initiate her vacuum procedure, sucking in stuff in front of her. This can be done at her own volition, with ease. Vacuumed objects will be compacted into her <strong>belly</strong>, also giving her a <strong>muffin-top</strong>. If she were to either <i>burp</i>, <i>hiccup</i>, <i>pout</i> her lips or <i>exhale</i> deeply, it would also activate her vacuum mouth. <i>Rubbing her belly while full has also seemed to result in the vacuum being triggered.</i> The bigger she is from normal height, the more effective and larger in scale her mouth deforms. She has <strong><u>2 suction strength options</u></strong>, which can be toggled by rotating the ring on her choker (like a dial) to the left. This will cycle the Suction strength mode.</p>

                        <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Originally the size of a vacuum hose-top. Able to suck up objects as heavy as humans.</p>

                        <p><strong>MAXIMUM:</strong> Even larger than Normal, supposed to be used in emergencies or to speed up clean-up. Can and will suck up almost anything in a 170 degree angle. 
                        <span style="color: red;">Requires more power to operate and will shut down other augments to work properly, such as <u>Vision</u> (eyes close), or <u>Processing Speed</u>.</span></p>

                        <br/>
                        <p>Upon vacuuming contents into her belly, the maid can process the contents inside. By default, this option is set to <strong>Compression</strong>, unaware of other modes. Other unused modes include Rinse, Disinfect, Freeze, Heat and <strong>Package</strong>.
                        <p><strong>Compression:</strong> The contents inside her belly get miniaturised into a cryogenic state, with all the mass being put to better use on her frame. The content is flushed (audible) down and can be seen forcing it's way over her hips giving her a large muffin-top as it enters the lower half of her body. This is by far the most advanced augment in her, and often times misjudged for 'digesting' her food. <strong>For reference <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/cratedcheese" target="_blank">CratedCheese</a> has illustrated the <a href="images/CratedCheese-454139-experiment 1.gif" target="_blank">process</a>, <a href="images/dapqnyr-fa0cabc1-3ea8-4b3e-934e-94dedabec624.gif" target="_blank">twice</a>.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Package:</strong> May be seen one day. The maid is able to package contents inside her belly with industry-grade plastic for no leaks, out the rear.</p>

                        <p>This is the delay with which to process contents inside. She has <strong><u>3 speed  options</u></strong>, which can be toggled by rotating the ring on her choker (like a dial) to the right. This will cycle the Processing Speed mode.</p>
                        <p><strong>Manual:</strong> Waits for the maid to trigger processing by pulling on her belly ring - the mass is forcefully flushed downward through another narrow entrance, displaying a large muffin-top as the maid pushes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Automatic:</strong> This processes objects automatically in a queue as they enter her belly. This requires more power/energy to work and results in only 60% of the processed contents returned back as gains. <span style="color: red;">Cannot operate at the same time as <u>MAXIMUM</u> suction strength.</span></p>
                        <p><strong>Background:</strong> The slowest type of processing, where contents are processed as slowly, quietly and efficiently as possible. Pressure Release is still present, and can be heard as a balloon deflating.</p>

                        <p>Any excess materials are released (farted) through the rear back into the world. The more content processed, the more pressure builds up, exponentially. Interestingly, for Compression, any flesh compressed releases a barrage of multiple, more forceful farts, instead of a long constant stream. How clean her filters are, dictate how clean the air is.</p>

                        <p>Compressing contents always leads to a large chunk of it adding to the maid's frame/body. Any form of meat or flesh <strong>adds to her curves</strong>, primarily her butt, then her hips & thighs, and lastly her breasts. Any non-meat, will be <strong>added to her height.</strong></p>
                        <p>If we are to get technical, it is assumed flesh is divided <strong>40%</strong> to her <i>butt</i>, <strong>30%</strong> to her <i>thighs</i>, and <strong>20%</strong> to her <i>breasts</i>, with the last <strong>10%</strong> to her <i>height</i> (negligible).</p>

    <p>The maid dons a <strong>french maid</strong> costume, showing a lot of skin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://sta.sh/211967xa5tns" target="_blank">Here is an artist's impression</a> of the maid by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/orso-chan" target="_blank">Orso-Chan</a>, the <strong>base shape</strong> and <strong>clothing</strong> are <u>spot-on</u>.</p>

    <p><strong>None</strong> of her clothes seem to tear, whatever the size of her body parts.</p>

    <p><strong>The maid has no teeth</strong>. If she were to open herm outh normally, it would reveal nothing but pitch blackness. This is easily nightmare-fuel, aside from staring into death when her vacuum is directly aimed at you.</p>

    <p>The maid seems to exhibit an alluring demeanour (almost aphrodisiac) with her <strong>half-open eye</strong> look.</p>

                <li><a href="http://www.mamabliss.com/blog/">Mamabliss</a>'s <a href="zip/disposal unit.zip">Garbage Disposal Unit</a> comic. This was a commission, as far as I know by none other than brainstorm from Eka's, as it contains his OC Gomu. I love everything about it. Especially the maid's personality, I wish I understood personalities well enough that I could extend this comic. The comic was hosted for free at Bellystuffed.com but as of June 2020, me checking for the site it was finally been retired. Yea I tried, or rather am still trying. <strong>This comic will be used often for reference poses if I ever feel I need to provide any.</strong></li>
        
                <li>Frakass created the earliest likeness this maid can be likened to. By this I mean Frakass's OC, <a href="https://aryion.com/g4/view/153953">Eveline</a>, which can be found on Eka's. There isn't much in the way of story about Eveline, but in short, she vacuums stuff to her belly, digests it, and farts roses.</li>

    <p>A maid is doing her rounds and discovers the next room has accumulated garbage which would take too much time to clean. So she decides to make use of her vacuum-disposal mechanism to get the job done in no time flat. The process sucks up all non-furniture objects including a heavy-sleeping average-size woman. All the garbage is sent to her belly. Once all collected, she pulls on her belly ring and the contents are compressed into gas to be expelled once complete, and replace the air of the room. To her surprise, the compression grants her curvier assets in all the right places.</p>

    <strong>Story Sent</strong>
    <p>Her next job has her enter into a dim-lit room. It's larger than the first, which means she needs to spread her air-freshener (farts) equally. For this, she sets her compression to Automatic (not manual) so that she can  vacuum and compress objects on the go. While doing this, she releases bursts of fresh air from her rear. Due to only needing to keep her head up, she doesn't notice a sticky surface on the ground, causing her to trip and fall forward on to her belly. This causes her suction-strength to shift to Maximum (from High). This makes her vacuum whole furniture & things anchored down including the chandelier. By the time she notices this and has turned her vacuum off, she has vacuumed up everything in the room, and a sound begins growing in her belly. This much mass causes her belly to rumble, and takes a few seconds to process & compress. And so, she closes her eyes, bites her lip seductively, and bombs the room with air-freshener while laying on her belly. She emerges from the fumes/thick cloud, out of the room still farting, yet proud.</p>

            </br>
            <p>A perverted scientist wanted to make the perfect servant, away from prying eyes. And he managed, he made a multi-purpose maid which could do take care of him and his house, but had no conscience. This only served to motivate the old man to keep working on her image recognition software, at the cost of his youth.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the russians kept experimenting with nuclear power. One day thought the next step in russian warfare to overthrow the american flag was to combine their women with their technology. To prototype, the Russians decided it would be best to first clean up their nuclear fallout at home. And so they did, they crafted what they called a 'Radiation Collection Unit', which could suck up any and all radiation she could detect, while remaining sexy. As a side-effect by the scientist, the Radiation Collector seemed to grow bigger with all the compressed radiation as mass. The tunguska event is said to have been thefancy work ofthe Radiation Collector, leaving no trace of radiation behind. Needless to say, something went wrong during testing as radio communication to the Radiaiton Collector sent improper signals, causing the Radiation Collector to go wild and get rid of a huge chunk of the russian nuclear arsenal. The experiment was deemed a failure, and abandoned, but only after the experiment having cost the government every ruble to cover up the accident.</p>

            <p>The perverted scientist of earlier was getting closer to a breakthrough AI so smart it could pass the turing test with flying colors. A mysterious gift wasl eft at his door one day, labelled declassified. It had been the Radiation Collector, well what was left of it. The scientist's research had paid off as the government wanted to see what could this old man now could do if heapplied his smart AI to the russian gear. And so the scientist got to work merging his invention with russian's, creating an even more lewd machination.</p>

            <p>On the day he wanted to showcase his handy-work to the world, to a hotel not far from his laboratory, something went wrong for the scientist, and it is believed, he is the first victim of the monster he created. But not before letting her know, the plan of the day, which she sets out to do.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verdict:</strong> The maid is at most an A-Tier predator in my fetish emporium. There are plenty of other predators more effective at her trade, but she could definitely make swiss cheese of anyone below her tier.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not nigh-invulnerable to brute force like all the S-Tiers, susceptible to acid, has no regeneration capability, noisey shoes & gadgets, and her strongest move (MAXIMUM), takes a while to start up and locks her in place.</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> What she does have going for her however is her immunity to smell, great crowd control (#1 in vacuuming), probably the windiest farts, and hiding stuff away thanks to miniaturisation. One could even say her night vision up to a certain extent, but she's not the only one with it.</li>
